Deep neural networks are very powerful because it can learn complex functions without human input. In recent years, there is a rise in Generative adversarial networks. Generative adversarial networks (GAN), a class of machine learning frameworks designed by Ian Goodfellow and his colleagues in June 2014. Two neural networks contest with each other in a game. 

LoGAN is a sub-class of GAN that deals with generating Logos. Here, _given the time constraint_,  I have used **30,000 images** from [Large Logo Dataset](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/sagea/lld/) to train the network for **1300 epoch** (cycle) in **2 weeks time**. Usually the network is trained for atleast _10,000+ epoches_. 

After training, I extract some logos and using Admin access added it to **mylogo.ai**
